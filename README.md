 Track cryptocurrency taxes using an order book

## General Info
 This is a program that I started writing circa 2018 to serve two primary purposes. First, it was a 'summer project' (I typically 
 delegate myself one computer science based project every summer...learning a new programming language, new library, etc.) to learn
  about the pandas library. Second, it was to enable me to maintain the ability to trade cryptocurrency without having to worry (as
  much) about how I would keep track of everything for taxes at the end of the year. It is for my personal use only and is certainly 
  not recommended for use on your own taxes (I'm not liable for anyone else's errors in reporting as a result of using this program). 
 Since it is a learning project, the code is extremely messy, lacks documentation, and should probably be rewritten from scratch. That
 being said, I've included it here as an example of things that I'm interested in working on and to serve as a point of reference for
 how far I've come and what I still need to improve upon.
